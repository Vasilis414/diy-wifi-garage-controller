Universal garage door controller for microcontrollers â€“ Pi, Arduino, ESP, and more.

Make Your Garage Door Smart with a Microcontroller

I turned my regular garage door opener into a smart controller using just a Raspberry Pi Zero. You can do the same with any microcontroller!

Step 1: Test Your Controller

Before starting, make sure your controller can work with this method:

Open your garage door remote and take out the circuit board.

Locate the button that normally opens the garage.

Take a wire and briefly touch both ends of the button contacts with it.

If the controller light turns on and your garage door opens, then this project will work for you!

Requirements

Garage door controller

Soldering iron + solder

Microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Zero recommended if you want to use my code)

Wires / jumper cables

Electrical tape (for insulation)

Notes from My Build

One common issue is weak wiring. Make sure the cables are firmly soldered to the controller board and connected well to the microcontroller. If the signal is weak, the remote may not activate properly. Youâ€™ll know itâ€™s working if the LED on the remote lights up just as brightly as when pressing the physical button.

Step 2: Wiring the Controller to the Microcontroller

Solder two wires onto the button contacts on the remote board.

Connect one wire to a GPIO pin and the other to GND on your microcontroller.

ðŸ‘‰ In my build, I used GPIO 23, but you can choose any free pin (just remember to update the code later).

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Donâ€™t directly jam the wire into the hole. First, fill it with some solder, then solder the wire onto it for a stronger connection. Finish by wrapping with insulating tape.

Step 3: Create the Script

Install Python on your Raspberry Pi.

Copy the provided webbuttonpress.py script (or find an equivalent script if using another microcontroller).
